<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>1889.</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>In the book, a Yankee engineer from Connecticut is accidentally transported back in time to the court of King Arthur, where he fools the inhabitants of that time into thinking that he is a magician, and soon uses his knowledge of modern technology to become a "magician" in earnest, stunning the English of the Early Middle Ages with such feats as demolitions, fireworks, and the shoring up of a holy well. He attempts to modernize the past, but in the end he is unable to prevent the death of Arthur and an interdict against him by the Catholic Church of the time, which grows fearful of his power.</p></td>

Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the book.</p></td>

<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>1897</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>Twain included a number of fictional stories in the body of what is otherwise a non-fiction work. In particular, the story of how Cecil Rhodes made his fortune by finding a newspaper in the belly of a shark, and the story of how a man named Ed Jackson made good in life out of a fake letter of introduction to Cornelius Vanderbilt, were anthologized in Charles Neider (ed) The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain, (Doubleday, 1957) where they are presented as fiction.</p></td>

<h3>Mark Twain's (Burlesque) Autobiography and First Romance</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>1871</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>The book bears no relationship to Twain's actual life. The two short stories present fictional characters who are supposedly part of Twain's lineage. In the final passage, Twain develops the story to a point of crisis, and then abruptly ends the tale, saying:

“	The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a particularly close place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get him (or her) out of it again—and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole business, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers—or else stay there. I thought it was going to be easy enough to straighten out that little difficulty, but it looks different now.	”
With that, Twain's "Autobiography" ends.[1]

The illustrations form an interesting aspect of this book. They have no relationship to the text of the book. Rather, they use cartoons illustrating the children's poem The House that Jack Built to lampoon the Erie Railroad Ring (the house) and its participants, Jay Gould, John T. Hoffman, and Jim Fisk.</p></td>

<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>1880</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>As the two men make their way through Germany, the Alps, and Italy, they encounter situations made all the more humorous by their reactions to them. The narrator (Twain) plays the part of the American tourist of the time, believing that he understands all that he sees, but in reality understanding none of it.</p></td>

<p>He worked on it intermittently from 1897 through 1908</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>Twain wrote multiple versions of the story; each involves a supernatural character called "Satan" or "No. 44". All the versions remained unfinished (with the debatable exception of the last one, No. 44, the Mysterious Stranger).</p></td>

<h3>The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today	</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="img/mark twain/images (5).jpg"/></td>
<td>
<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>1873</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p> It satirizes greed and political corruption in post–Civil War America in the era now referred to as the Gilded Age. Although not one of Twain's best-known works, it has appeared in more than one hundred editions since its original publication. Twain and Warner originally had planned to issue the novel with illustrations by Thomas Nast. The book is remarkable for two reasons–-it is the only novel Twain wrote with a collaborator, and its title very quickly became synonymous with graft, materialism, and corruption in public life.</p></td>

<h3>Letters from the Earth</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p>March 1939</p>
<h4>About:</h4>
<p>Letters from the Earth consists of a series of commentaries in essay and short story form. Many of these pieces express Twain's discomfort with and disdain for Christianity, both as a theological position and a lifestyle. The title story consists of eleven letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels Gabriel and Michael,[1] about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. Other pieces in the book include a morality tale told as a bedtime discussion with Twain's children, Susy and Clara, about a family of cats, and an essay explaining why an anaconda is morally superior to Man.</p></td>
