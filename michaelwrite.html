<h3> Moonwalk</h3>
<h4>Published in:</h4>
<p> The book was first published by Doubleday on February 1, 1988, five months after the release of Jackson's 1987 Bad album, and named after Jackson's signature dance move, the moonwalk.</p>
<h4>About</h4>
<p>In the book, Jackson tells of the beatings he received from his father, Joseph. While rehearsing with The Jackson 5, Jackson stated that when they messed up they "got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch."[3] The singer added that his father was "real strict" and "something of a mystery".[3] In September 1988, Jackson telephoned his father to apologize for some of the material in the autobiography. He explained that he hadn't written the book himself and that the critical content was written by "someone else".[5] The singer also reveals how much he has been hurt by the press, asking, "What happened to truth? Did it go out of style?"</p>

<h4>About</h4>
<p>Dancing the Dream includes approximately 100 photographs.

Furthermore, the volume included photographs converted from stills of Jackson's music videos "Black or White" (1991) and "Remember the Time" (1992), in addition to images of his 1991 performance at MTV's tenth anniversary celebration. Jackson commissioned artwork for Dancing the Dream from Nate Giorgio and David Nordahl, whom Jackson met in the 1980s and subsequently developed a professional relationship</p>
