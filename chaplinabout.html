<h3>Charlie Chaplin</h3>
<p>One of the most popular and legendary comedians, the name of Charlie Chaplin is eternally synonymous with comedy and humour. He was easily one of the greatest stars in the silent film era and left audiences in a riot of laughter with his rib-tickling screen persona. In a career spanning over seventy five years, Chaplin gave many memorable and great performances. This versatile comic genius acted, directed, produced, wrote and composed music for almost all of his films and was recognized as ‘The Little Tramp’, the character he played in his films. An icon in world cinema, Chaplin is widely accepted as one of the founding fathers of the genre of comedy and has influenced an array of filmmakers and comedians. Even today, many of his films are extremely popular and are hailed as classics. Some of his greatest films include ‘Modern Times’, ‘The Great Dictator’, ‘The Gold Rush’, ‘The Immigrant’ and ‘The Kid’.</p>
<h3>Childhood & Early Life</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Charles Spencer Chaplin was born into a family of entertainers to Hannah Chaplin and Charles Chaplin Sr.- both of whom were music hall entertainers.</li>
<li>His childhood was marked with poverty and struggle. His parents did not earn much and hence he started to work at a workhouse at the age of seven.</li>
<li>In 1898, his mother was admitted to a mental asylum, after she was diagnosed with psychosis. This deeply affected him and soon his father too became a severe alcoholic and he was left to fend for himself.</li>
