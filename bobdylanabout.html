<h3>Bob Dylan</h3>
<p>One of the major figures of the folk and pop music movement in the United States, Bob Dylan is not just a singer or song-writer—he is an institution in himself. With a career spanning over five decades, Dylan has been the darling of generations of music lovers. Maybe that’s why he refuses to associate his name with the music of any particular generation. Breaking into the folk music scenario during the 1960s, he strived to make not just enjoyable, foot-tapping music, but endeavored to create social and political awareness through the lyrics of his songs. A rebel, he was not someone to conform to the existing norms of popular music of his era. Instead he chose to experiment with his music and lyrics and revolutionized the genre of pop as well as folk music. His works cover a wide range of musical genres—blues, country, gospel, folk, and rock and roll. The talented musician is also a multi-instrumentalist who can play the guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. He is a versatile singer though his biggest contribution to the world of music is considered to be his songwriting. His songs revolve around the issues facing the common man, be they social, political, or philosophical. The musician also loves to paint and his works have been displayed in major art galleries.</p>

<h3>Career</h3>
<ul>
	<li>He changed his name to “Bob Dylan” when he started performing. After quitting college in 1960 he went to New York City in 1961 in order to pursue a career in music. He started playing at clubs and explored the music scenario.</li>
<li>His eponymous debut album, ‘Bob Dylan’ was released in 1962. It contained folk songs and two of Dylan’s compositions. The album did not do well.</li>
<li>The next album he released, ‘The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan’ (1963) became a big hit in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album was a combination of protest songs, love songs, and blues with social messages which greatly appealed to the audience and popularized the singer.</li>
<li>Over the 1960s he became immensely popular both as a song-writer and a singer. During this time he also actively became involved in the civil rights movement. One of his biggest hits, the single, ‘Like a Rolling Stone’ was released in 1965 which peaked at no. 1 in the UK charts.</li>
<li>In the 1970s he ventured into films and starred in the 1973 Western drama ‘Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid’. He also composed and sang several songs for the film. The film however was a failure at the box office.</li>
<li>He embarked on a year-long world tour in 1978 in which he was accompanied by an eight piece band and three backing singers. He performed concerts in Japan, Europe and the US, giving a total of 114 shows. This tour earned him more than $20 million.</li>
<li>Over the 1980s he took to touring more, and often collaborated with other musicians and bands. He toured extensively with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during 1986-87. Some of his biggest albums of the period include ‘Infidels’ (1983), ‘Knocked Out Loaded’ (1986) and ‘Oh Mercy’ (1989).</li>
<li>He continued performing throughout the 1990s though he was no longer one of the top musicians. But he surprised his dissenters by producing the album, ‘Time Out of Mind’ in 1997 which went on to win three Grammy Awards including Album of the Year award.</li>
<li>The prolific singer continued releasing albums, touring and performing stage shows well into the 2000s even though now he was in his sixties. Ever the music lover, he still keeps active and released the album ‘Tempest’ in 2012.</li>
<li>Mark Twain earned a large amount of money from his books which he invested in several business ventures.</li> <li>However, many of the ventures failed, plunging him into financial difficulties. In order to stave off bankruptcy, he began writing more frequently in the early 1890s which affected the quality of his works.</li>
<li>Unable to cope with the increasing financial pressures, he filed for bankruptcy in 1894. His friend, the financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, came to Twain’s aid at this difficult time and helped him in re-establishing himself financially.</li>
<li>A highly popular person, he was also in great demand as a featured speaker, performing solo humorous talks and giving speeches in men’s clubs. A staunch anti-imperialist, he was made the vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League in 1901. He also supported civil rights and women’s suffrage.</li>
